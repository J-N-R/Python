# Python Libraries
## Project 2

In this project, I took it upon myself to dive into and learn 3 new Python Libraries, and make some neat code examples with them. 

Those three libraries are:
  * NumPy
  * Requests / Beautiful Soup
  * PyWin32

This Repository folder hosts all the mini projects I made with these libraries, and you're free to check them out!
