# Is Covid Near Me?
This GUI application allows users to input their state and county, and instantly get results on how many cases and deaths are in their county!

## Notes
The GUI is powered by John Welle's graphics.py library.

Also, the inputs aren't case sensitive, and don't need to be exact! But, please refrain from using state abbreviations such as NJ, as the code will be unlikely to pick up on it.
