## Project #1: Are People Coming Back Inside?

- [Project 1 Link](https://github.com/J-N-R/Python/tree/main/Project1)

- <b>Description:</b>  Amid the COVID 19 Crisis, although the virus is still spreading, vaccinations and the public's opinion on the pandemic is changing. This Project seeks to determine whether or not people are becoming more confident in their safety, and are starting to go outside more. To do this, it grabs and processes public traffic data from (link), and from an analysis of that data, we can find out if more people are travelling, which can correlate to how confident the public is in their safety.


## Project #2: Exploring Python Libraries!

- [Project 2 Link](https://github.com/J-N-R/Python/tree/main/Project2)

- <b>Description:</b>  For this project, I dived in and took on the challenge of learning 3 new python libraries, and creating a mini program for each and every one of them. 


## Project #3: Is Covid Near Me?

- [Project 3 Link](https://github.com/J-N-R/Python/tree/main/Project3)

- <b>Description:</b>  Once I've finally finished learning the essentials of Python, I took it upon myself to create this final project. For this project, I created an App that allows you to see whether or not covid is around you! Using John Zelle's graphics.py library, and powered by pandas and [a live, constantly updating database of covid data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/live/us-counties.csv), this app allows anyone to input their state and county, and see how many cases of COVID and COVID related deaths are around them in their county, giving them much needed insight to how safe their local environment is!
